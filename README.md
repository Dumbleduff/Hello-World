I'm supposed to write a bit about myself, I don't know if the world will be able to see this but wth. My name is Linus, I'm 17 and I am planning on joining a school for game programming and I thought that it might be smart to learn github, I've tried programming before, done some online courses but it hasnt really worked, i think i need a more structured approach which i hope i will get at the school. well, thats all for now byeeeeeeeeeeeeee.

i'm sorry, thats cancer
